# Performance-Manager

A C# UWP App with 8 buttons demonstrating CPU-bound and I/O-bound operations.  
One also has a textbox where we must write the exact button name (operation) and run the operation before  
using the measurer button.  
To use the **Get JSON Data** button, you must run the **ServerSide** project first while also having the UWP App open.  

The JSON Data:
